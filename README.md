# Calculator - Yash Dalal

I made a calculator that does basic math and is easy to use.

Basic functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide

Additional support: decimals, negative numbers, chained operations ( -2 + 3 = 1 / 2 = 0.5 * 10 = 5)

Calculators are fun but you know what's more fun? Adele calculators. Hidden throughout the app are Adele themed easter eggs to make the experience of doing math more fun. Here are some ways you can reveal easter eggs:

1. If the answer of your calculations evaluates to the title of Adele's [1st](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_(Adele_album)), [2nd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(Adele_album)) or [3rd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25_(Adele_album)) albums.
2. If you shake the phone. (ctrl-cmd-Z in the iOS simulator) This one works best with the volume on. Be careful though, it can get loud!


Below, I've pasted some screenshots to give you a glimpse of the app:
